    <p>Perfect for breakfast or afternoon snack, you'll fall in love with this recipe!</p>
    <p>The base recipe is neutral in flavor, so you can go either to the sweet side or savory. 
        Or both! There's a famous Brazilian duo called "Romeo and Juliete", which basically cheese and guava paste.
        It's absolutely delicius!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the pancake</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup (24g) - Cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1 table spoon Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>pinch Salt</li>
        <li>2 tea spoons Stevia</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For filling options</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese of you preference</li>
        <p>-- There's fat free options that are very low in calories and the melt just like regular cheese.</p>
        <li>Cottage cheese</li>
        <p>-- This is great for both savory and sweet. Perfect with some honey drizzle!</p>
        <li>Guava paste</li>
        <p>-- Sugary option, so go easy with it! Always weight your, specially high calorie's food like sweets and fats.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the cornmeal and the egg and let it stand for about 5min. (To hydrate the corn flour)</li>
        <li>Heat up your non-stick pan(small size - 8in) in medium temperature</li>
        <li>Spray your pan or use a little butter</li>
        <li>Mix in the parmesan, pinch of salt and Stevia(if going to the sweet side add more)</li>
        <li>Bring the mix to the pan and lower the heat. Cover and let it cook.</li>
        <li>When it's almost done, turn to golden the other side.</li>
        <li>Add the filling of you choice</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can either fold it like the picture or eat like regular pancakes with some toppings of you choice!</p>
    <p>I personally love to add some cheese while still in the pan and then add melted guava sauce on top</p>
    <p>-- To melt the guava paste just cut a few pieces and add a spoon of water and heat it up in the microwave little by little.
          Watch out because it can get super hot!!
